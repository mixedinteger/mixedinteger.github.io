We present theorems of the alternative for the existence of a solution, polynomial algorithms for solving dyadic linear programs, and we study dyadic dual solutions. For set covering problems with an ideal constraint matrix, Seymour conjectured that an optimal dyadic dual solution always exists.

Working with a restricted set of variables (or columns), column generation iteratively adds new variables to the model until an optimal basis is found.  In this presentation, we propose an alternative approach that instead works with a relaxed set of columns, from which infeasible ones are iteratively eliminated.  As the total number of columns can typically be exponentially large, we use relaxed decision diagrams to compactly represent and manipulate the set of columns.  We discuss methodological insights and experimentally compare column elimination and column generation on two applications: graph coloring and truck-drone routing.

If C is the covariance matrix, then we are simply seeking to maximize the determinant of an order-s principal submatrix. A key application is for the contraction of an environmental-monitoring network. MESP sits within the intersection of optimization and data science, and so it has attracted a lot of recent attention. The problem is NP-hard, and there have been algorithmic attacks aimed at exact solution of moderate-sized instance for three decades. It is a fascinating problem from the perspective of integer nonlinear optimization, as it does not easily fit within a framework that is successfully attacked via available general-purpose paradigms. I will give an overview of algorithmic work, concentrating on recent developments. (<a href="slides/jlee.pdf">slides</a>)</p></td></tr>

When the set is described by linear inequalities, thanks to the Farkas lemma, we know that every valid inequality can be obtained using aggregations. When the inequalities describing the set are two quadratics, Yildiran (2009) showed that the convex hull of the set is given by at most two aggregated inequalities. In this work, we study the case of a set described by three or more quadratic inequalities. We show that, under technical assumptions, the convex hull of a set described by three quadratic inequalities can be obtained via (potentially infinitely many) aggregated inequalities. We also show, through counterexamples, that such a result does not hold if either the technical conditions are relaxed or if we consider four or more inequalities.

A unifying concept is that the standard extended formulation for polynomial optimization, where any such problem can be represented as a linear (or semidefinite) program with nonconvex side constraints.  Many techniques from integer programming (LP + integer side constraints) can thus be ported over to polynomial optimization.</p></td></tr>

Rather than direct solution of OPF, the Karush -- Kuhn -- Tucker (KKT) conditions for the OPF problem in question may be written, and in parallel the LMPs of generators and loads may be expressed in terms of the OPF Lagrange multipliers. The KKT conditions provide a means of algebraically solving for these Lagrange multipliers. However, many of the variables inherent in this solution will be zero, corresponding to power lines which are not saturated at their thermal limits. We propose a classification scheme to determine which of the power lines are saturated, thus highlighting the nonzero Lagrange multipliers that must be solved for. This is a joint work with R.

The core of our approach is the first polynomial-time algorithm for the weighted stable set problem on graphs that do not contain more than k vertex-disjoint odd cycles, where k is any constant. Previously, polynomial-time algorithms were only known for k=0 (bipartite graphs) and for k=1. We observe that integer linear programs defined by coefficient matrices with bounded subdeterminants and two nonzeros per column can be also solved in strongly polynomial-time, using a reduction to b-matching.

The two approaches are compared in terms of resulting model tightness and size (number of discrete and continuous variables, and constraints). Computational results are presented with examples from the areas of process flowsheet synthesis and optimization of electric power expansion planning.

A binary extended formulation of a polyhedron P is obtained by adding to the original description of P binarizations of some of its variables. In the context of mixed-integer programming, imposing integrality on 0/1 variables rather than on general integer variables has interesting convergence properties and has been studied both from the theoretical and from the practical point of view. We propose a notion of natural binarizations and binary extended formulations, encompassing all the ones studied in the literature. We give a simple characterization of the vertices of such formulations, which allows us to study their behavior with respect to  sequential convexification. In particular, given a binary extended formulation and one of its variables x, we study a parameter  that measures the progress made towards ensuring the integrality of x via application of sequential convexification. We formulate this parameter, which we call rank, as the solution of a set covering problem and express it exactly for the classical binarizations from the literature.

Motivated by the inability of tree ensembles to model multilinear functions of continuous variables, we then propose a generalization of decision-trees and provide empirical evidence of a better out-of-sample fit for a large collection of randomly perturbed nonlinear functions.

We propose a bilevel optimization model to address this challenge, in which the leader problem determines the ODMTS design, and the follower problems identify the most cost efficient and convenient route for riders under the chosen design. The leader model contains a choice model for every potential rider that determines whether the rider adopts the ODMTS given her proposed route. To solve this model, we  propose an exact decomposition method that includes Benders optimal cuts and nogood cuts to ensure the consistency of the rider choices in the leader and follower problems. Moreover, to improve computational efficiency, we derive upper bounds on trip durations for the follower problems and valid inequalities that strenghten the nogood cuts. The proposed method is validated using an extensive computational study on a real data set on Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti region in Michigan. The designed ODMTS feature high adoption rates and significantly shorter trip durations compared to the existing transit system and highlight the benefits in accessibility for low-income riders. Finally, the computational study demonstrates the efficiency of the decomposition method that improve the baseline method by several orders of magnitude.</p></td></tr>

To manage these constraints and smooth out the expenditure across auctions, the bidders (or the platform on behalf of them) often employ pacing: each bidder is assigned a multiplier between 0 and 1, and her bid on each item is multiplicatively scaled down by the multiplier. This naturally gives rise to a game in which each bidder strategically selects a multiplier, which gives rise to the pacing equilibrium solution concept. In this work, we show that the problem of finding an approximate pacing equilibrium is PPAD-complete for second-price auctions. This resolves an open question of [CKSSM17]. As a consequence of our hardness result, we refute the conjecture by [BCI+07] that tâtonnement-style budget-management dynamics will converge efficiently for repeated second-price auctions. Our hardness result also implies the existence of a refinement of supply-aware market equilibria which is hard to compute with simple linear utilities. Interestingly, the computational hardness for this problem also translates into a seemingly-difficult problem for MIP solvers. I will show some experimental results on small-scale instances where we are unable to find solutions at around 15 buyers and auctions. (<a href="slides/kroer.pdf">slides</a>)</p></td></tr>

This is in contrast with the Simplex method that always admits an exponential bound. We introduce a new polynomial-time path-following interior point method where the number of iterations also admits a singly exponential upper bound. This complements previous work by Allamigeon, Benchimol, Gaubert, and Joswig (SIAGA 2018) that exhibited a family of instances where any path-following method must take exponentially many iterations. For an n variable linear program in standard form, the number of iterations of our algorithm is at most O(n1.5 log n) times the number of segments of any piecewise linear curve in the wide neighbourhood of the central path. In particular, it matches the number of iterations of any path following interior point method up to this polynomial factor. The overall exponential upper bound derives from studying the ‘max central path’, a piecewise-linear curve with the number of pieces bounded by the total length of 2n shadow vertex simplex paths.

There are many standard techniques that lead to a 2-approximation for WTAP, but despite much progress on special cases, the factor 2 remained unbeaten for several decades. In this talk we present two algorithms for WTAP that improve on the longstanding approximation ratio of 2. The first algorithm is a relative greedy algorithm, which starts with a simple, though weak, solution and iteratively replaces parts of this starting solution by stronger components. This algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of (1 + ln 2 + epsilon) < 1.7. Second, we present a local search algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of 1.5 + epsilon (for any constant epsilon > 0). We then show how our local search technique can be applied to Steiner Tree, leading to an alternative way to obtain the currently best known approximation factor of ln 4 + epsilon. This is joint work with Rico Zenklusen.</p></td></tr>

In this work, we decide HVAC control schedules under uncertain PV generation, using a distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) building load control model under Wasserstein ambiguity sets. We derive strengthened mixed integer linear programming (MILP) reformulations for DRCC problems with right-hand side uncertainty. To achieve tradeoff between the operational risk and costs, we propose an adjustable chance-constrained variant. MILP and conic reformulations are derived. Using real-world data, we conduct computational studies to demonstrate the efficiency of the solution approaches and the effectiveness of the solutions.</p></td></tr>

In particular, we present a class of valid cuts that improve existing semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations and are $\epsilon$-separable in polynomial time. We connect our cuts to the literature on the optimal power flow (OPF) problem by demonstrating that previously derived cuts capturing a convex hull important for OPF are actually just special cases of our cuts.
