          <i>Over last decade the growth of the MIP community has been impressive. With MIP workshop going international in 2024, the number of direct partakers of MIP events will definitely grow substantially as well. My primary motivation stems from providing a South-East Asian perspective to COMIPS, and helping serve the interests of the global MIP community. Whilst organizing the MIP International workshop I learnt about the growing academic community in India whose research interests span MIP at large, however not have had opportunities to be associated with MIP community. As a member of the COMIPS, I would like to contribute to fostering wholistic and sustainable growth of the MIP community.</i>

          <i>I think the MIP Workshop is the most valuable conference in our field because it brings the people who are devoted to MIP research together to exchange their ideas. It’s also a great venue to give young researchers and students an opportunity to show their MIP research and to draw them into this great community.
            Our field has a long history of successfully transferring ideas from academics into successful commercial and open source software products. The MIP Workshop should foster and extend this collaboration.
            I attended 13 of the 21 MIP Workshops so far, gave invited talks at two of them (2012 in Davis and 2017 in Montréal), and was a member of the program committee 2018 at Clemson.</i>

            I am a faculty member at Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, after having completed my PhD at UW-Madison and a postdoc at TU Dresden. As one of the co-organizers of DOTs, an online event sponsored by MIPS, I am deeply committed to fostering an inclusive and engaging community in mixed-integer programming. Our seminars have attracted close to 100 attendees, and recordings are available on YouTube. I really value MIP workshops for their welcoming atmosphere, excellent-quality talks, and broad representation of the MIP spectrum. I strongly believe in keeping MIPS events open to all and free whenever feasible. Joining COMIPS would allow me to help sustain and enhance these values.
