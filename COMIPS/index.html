          <p> COMIPS is the governing board of the Mixed-Integer Programming Society, a recently created section of the Mathematical Optimization Society. Its 		main duties are: ensuring the continuity of the MIP Workshop, approving the new MIP organizing committee and auditing its financial reports.</p>

	  <p> The COMIPS consists of three elected officials, plus the chairs of the last two MIP organizing committees, which in this case correspond to:</p>
	  <ul>
	  <li>Yuri Faenza (Columbia University) </li>
	  <li>Yuan Zhou (University of Kentucky) </li>
          <li>Carla Michini (University of Wisconsin-Madison)</li>
	  </ul>

	<p>
	You can find the bylaws <a href="https://www.mixedinteger.org/MIS-bylaws-0228.pdf">here</a>
	</p>
	<p>Below you can find the list of candidates (in alphabetical order) for the first COMIPS election. The voting portal is <a href="https://vote.electionrunner.com/election/TbPAS">Election Runner</a>; every eligible voter will receive credentials during Dec. 18 and can vote for up to three candidates.</p>

	<i>In my opinion, the MIP Workshop is the most valuable conference in our field. I attended 12 of the 19 MIP Workshops so far, gave invited talks at two of them (2012 in Davis and 2017 in Montréal), and was a member of the program committee 2018 at Clemson. It is especially important for me that the MIP Workshop continues to feature practical applications and implementational aspects of mixed integer programming solvers. Our field has a long history of successfully transferring theorems and ideas from academics into very successful commercial and open source software products. I think the MIP Workshop should foster and extend this collaboration as much as it can. </i>

My work (published in, e.g., MathProg, Algorithmica, EJOR) is both methodological and applied and some of it (appeared in e.g., IJCAI, AAAI, AI Journal) also touches on topics of AI, game theory, and ML. I have experience with the industry thanks to working with 20+ companies in research projects and student supervision across Italy, Germany, and the UK. While a MIPper at heart, I have a good grasp of the main research trends of the ever-growing AI/ML community and, if elected, I would strive to facilitate its collaboration with the MIP community, working to promote MIP techniques within mathematical optimization, data science, and machine learning. </i>
